# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data from Our World in Data. This project analyzes COVID-19 trends across Kenya, United States, India, Australia, and Japan using real-world data from Our World in Data.

We explore cases, deaths, and vaccination rollouts to identify global patterns, differences between countries, and key insights from the pandemic's progression.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and filtering
- Time-series analysis
- Death rate and vaccination progress comparison
- Visualizations saved as PNG files

## Tools
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

 Data Source
[Our World in Data - COVID-19 Dataset](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv)
## Key Insights

1. United States had the highest number of cases and deaths overall.  
2. India experienced a major surge in mid-2021, leading to its highest daily case records.  
3. Australia had a slower start to vaccinations but eventually achieved high full vaccination rates.  
4. Japan maintained a low death rate compared to its case count, indicating strong healthcare response.  
5. Kenya showed relatively lower total cases and deaths, which could be due to underreporting or low testing rates.

## Conclusion

This analysis shows how different countries managed the pandemic in diverse ways. From early containment to delayed vaccination rollouts, the timeline and impact of COVID-19 varied widely.

Further studies could look into:
- Government response effectiveness
- Correlation between testing rates and reported cases
- Healthcare capacity vs death rates
